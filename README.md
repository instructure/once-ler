# once-ler

[<img src="https://secure.travis-ci.org/instructure/once-ler.png?rvm=1.9.3" />](http://travis-ci.org/instructure/once-ler)

once-ler supercharges your `let`s and `before`s with the performance
of `before(:all)`. You get the performance of fixtures without all the
headaches.

## Setup

Add it to your Gemfile

```ruby
gem "once-ler"
```

And then in spec_helper.rb (or wherever):

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include Onceler::BasicHelpers
end
```

## Basic usage

### before(:once) { ... }

Change a slow `before` to `before(:once)` to speed it up.

### let_once(...) { ... }

Change a slow `let` (or `let!`) to `let_once` to speed it up.

### subject_once(...) { ... }

Change a slow `subject` (or `subject!`) to `subject_once` to speed it up.

### around(:once) { ... }

Need to run something around all of your once blocks (like freezing time)?
Use this.

### around(:once_and_each) { ... }

Shorthand for around(:once) + around(:each). Be careful, as you cannot
share state with instance variables between arounds and examples, so
use local variables if you want to say freeze time consistently
between all before(*) and examples. Also, the block is called twice (once for
:once and once for :each), so be careful using, e.g. Time.now in the block.

## Ambitious usage

If you're feeling bold, you can automatically speed up all
`let`s/`before`s in an example group:

```ruby
describe "something" do
  onceler!

  let(:foo) { ... }      # behaves like let_once
  before { ... }         # behaves like before(:once)

  # but if you need explict eaches, you can still do them:
  let_each(:foo) { ... }
  before(:each) { ... }
end
```

## Configuration

once-ler adds two new `before`/`after` scopes, `:record` and `:reset`, in
case you need to implement additional logic. `:record` runs in
conjunction with once-ler's recording phase (the implicit `before :all`).
`:reset` runs in conjunction with its cleanup phase (database rollback,
implicit `after :all`). As opposed to `:all`/`:context` hooks, these ones
are inherited down, and will run before/after any nested once-ler setup/
teardown.

They can be used globally, or in a particular group. For example:

```ruby
Onceler.configure do |config|
  config.before :record do
    # reset some caching to ensure all recordings get a blank slate
  end
end

describe Foo do
  before(:record) { Foo.stubs(:enabled?).returns(true) }
  after(:record)  { Foo.unstub(:enabled?) } # can't serialize stubs
  before(:each)   { Foo.stubs(:enabled?).returns(true) }

  context "lol" do
    before :once do
      # something that needs the stub to work
    end
    # ...
  end

  context "wut" do
    it do
      # something that needs the stub to work
    end
  end

  # ...
end
```

## How much of a speedup will I get?

YMMV, it depends on how bad your `let`s/`before`s are. For example,
adding once-ler to a subset of [canvas-lms](https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms)'s
model specs (spec/models/a*) **reduces their runtime by 40%**.

## How does it work?

Any `before(:once)`/`let_once` blocks will run just once for the current
context/describe block, before any of its examples run. Any side effects
(ivars) and return values will be recorded, and will then be reapplied
before each spec in the block runs. once-ler uses nested transactions
(savepoints) to ensure that specs don't mess with each other's database
rows.

This can give you a dramatic speedup, since you can minimize the number
of activerecord callbacks/inserts/updates.

## Caveats

* If you are doing anything database-y, you need to use transactional
  test via `use_transactional_fixtures=true`
* Your once'd blocks should have no side effects other than database
  statements, return values, and instance variables.
* Your return values and instance variables:
  1. need to be able to handle a `Marshal.dump`/`load` round trip.
     RSpec mocks/doubles can't.
  1. should implement `#==`. For built-ins types (e.g. String) or models,
     this isn't a problem, but if it's a custom class you might need to
     go override `Object#==`
* Your once'd blocks' behavior should not depend on side effects of other
  non-once'd blocks. For example:
  * a `before(:once)` block should not reference instance variables set by a
    `before` (but the inverse is fine).
  * a `let_once` block should not call non-once'd `let`s or `subject`s.
* Because all `let_once`s will be recorded and replayed (even if not used
  in a particular example), you should ensure they don't conflict with
  each other (e.g. unique constraint violations, or one `let_once`
  mutating the return value of another).
